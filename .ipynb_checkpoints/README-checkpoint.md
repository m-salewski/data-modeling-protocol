# data-exploration-protocol

Here we establish a standardized protocol for exploring data, and selecting/engineering features.

The contents of this repo contain some examples (NBs and datasets) which were adapted from kaggle kernels exemplifying basic data exploration concepts.

The file `protocol_README.md` is a summary of the methods used in the NBs.
