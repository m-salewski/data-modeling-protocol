# Machine Learning Methodology â€“ step by step

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and formatting
3. Feature engineering
4. Try and compare various machine learning models on a performance metric
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning for most promising models
6. Train best models on full data set and submit predictions

In **data cleaning and formatting** will especially take care of:

- Missing values
- Wrong values
- Wrong datatypes
- Outliers
- Skewed distributions
