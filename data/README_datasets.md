# Sberbank Russian Housing Market

[sberbank-russian-housing-market](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/data)

The aim of this competition is to _predict the sale price of each property_. The target variable is called price_doc in train.csv.

The training data is from August 2011 to June 2015, and the test set is from July 2015 to May 2016. The dataset also includes information about overall conditions in Russia's economy and finance sector, so you can focus on generating accurate price forecasts for individual properties, without needing to second-guess what the business cycle will do.

Update: please see the pinned discussion thread for some optional extra data, resolving an issue with some GIS features.
